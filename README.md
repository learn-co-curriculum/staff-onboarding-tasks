- **Get some swag.** Introduce yourself to Jess Parker (Campus Manager), and ask her for some swag! We have t-shirts and stickers.

- **Sign up for gym benefit (only if you want to).** Flatiron School offers a membership to NY Health and Racquet Club. There are 9 locations in NYC, including one a few blocks away from 11 Broadway. If you'd like a membership, get a form from Mike Linshi and bring it to the Whitehall St location. Flatiron School will pay NYHRC directly, so there is no reimbursement process involved.
