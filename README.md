# Things to do in real life

- **Take a campus tour.** You'll probably walk around when you're onboarding, but make sure to talk a roundabout campus and check out where our classrooms are, where to find supplies, and what Borg is :) 


- **Get some swag.** Introduce yourself to Julian Shapiro (Campus Manager), and ask him for some swag! We have t-shirts, sweatshirts and stickers. Go see what's in stock for you :)


- **Sign up for gym benefit (only if you want to).** Flatiron School offers a membership to NY Health and Racquet Club. There are 9 locations in NYC, including one a few blocks away from 11 Broadway. If you'd like a membership, get a form from Sarah Fox and bring it to the Whitehall St location. Flatiron School will pay NYHRC directly, so there is no reimbursement process involved.
